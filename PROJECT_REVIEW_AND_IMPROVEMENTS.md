- **Features Needed**:
  - List all saved sites
  - Add new sites
  - Edit existing sites
  - Delete sites
  - Set default site
  - Site details (address, contact, notes)
- **Current State**: Sites can be selected in booking flow, but no dedicated management page
- **Impact**: Clients cannot manage their collection sites efficiently
- **Reference**: Mentioned in `ROLE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` line 43

#### 2. **Driver Job History Page** (`/history` or `/jobs/history`)
- **Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required For**: Driver role
- **Features Needed**:
  - View completed jobs

#### 3. **Driver "Arrived" Status State**
- **Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Current Flow**: `booked` → `en-route` → `collected` → `warehouse`
- **Required Flow**: `booked` → `en-route` → `arrived` → `collected` → `warehouse`
- **Issue**: Missing intermediate "arrived" state when driver reaches the site
- **Impact**: Less granular tracking of driver progress
- **Location**: `DriverJobView.tsx` line 148 comment mentions "arrived" but it's not implemented

- **Required For**: Admin role
- **Features Needed**:
  - Review completed grading before final approval
  - Approve booking completion
  - Generate final reports
  - Completion checklist
- **Current State**: Jobs can be "finalised" but no approval workflow
- **Impact**: No formal approval process before marking bookings as completed
- **Reference**: `LIFECYCLE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` line 70-76

- **Status**: ⚠️ BASIC IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS
- **Required Enhancements**:
  - Show resale values for client bookings
  - Commission calculation breakdown based on resale
  - Link commission to specific bookings
  - Commission trends/charts
- **Current State**: Commission page exists but may not show resale value details
- **Impact**: Resellers need better visibility into earnings based on asset resale
- **Reference**: `LIFECYCLE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` line 131-136

#### 7. **Driver Route/Schedule View**
- **Status**: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
- **Required For**: Driver role
- **Features Needed**:
  - Today's assigned jobs list
  - Route optimization (mock)
  - Map view of job locations
  - Estimated travel times
- **Current State**: Drivers see jobs list but no route planning
- **Impact**: Drivers cannot plan their routes efficiently

## 📝 Notes

- All features should maintain **Milestone 1 compliance** (frontend-only, mock data)
- Follow existing patterns: Services → Hooks → Pages
- Use existing UI components from `components/ui/`
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Add proper loading, error, and empty states
- Update documentation after implementation
